This is a web-based facility booking system for schools and is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Set up your bookable rooms, day schedule and timetable for the year. Add user accounts, and allow them to make and manage bookings from anywhere.


It is web-based - PHP and MySQL - and currently uses the [CodeIgniter 3](https://codeigniter.com/) framework.
